I really need help with this Orc problem. They are stopping all of our shipments of goods and soon the town will be in real trouble if someone dosent put a stop to it. I would go my self but I really need to stay and take care of the town. Can you help? The reward is 100gp."

Rumor has it that they are hold up in what is known as Cragmaw castle. We need to find this castle and rid it of the goblin hoard. Only then do we have hope of finding the Rockseeker brothers. Maybe one of the goblins will know where they are. Will you help?"
