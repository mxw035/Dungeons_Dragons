    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p id="d">As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbing ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the rugged hills. The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard of sorts, adjacent to the broken stump of an old tower. A colorful tenet has been set up in the middle of the courtyard but no one is in sight.</p>
