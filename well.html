<h1>Old Owl Well</h1>
<div class="w3-third w3-teal">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbing ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the rugged hills. The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard of sorts, adjacent to the broken stump of an old tower. A colorful tenet has been set up in the middle of the courtyard but no one is in sight.</p>
