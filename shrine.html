When opened the door leads to a small yard. Chickens are running around trying to catch worms and other bugs that live in the grass. Her home is a small cottage tucked into the corner of the yard. She welcomes you in to a small room with a open door way straight ahead and a closed door on the right. She invites you to sit at the chairs around the table to the left.'Welcome to my home. Please take a seat while I put water on for tea. Oh my name is Sister Garaele'. She walkes through the open door way and there is the clear sound of water being put into a kettel and rummaging in a cuppord."
